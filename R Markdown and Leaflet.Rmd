## Intro

Create a web page using R Markdown that features a map created with Leaflet. 

Host your webpage on either GitHub Pages, RPubs, or NeoCities.

Your webpage must contain the date that you created the document, and it must contain a map created with Leaflet. 

## Mapping Clusters

```{r}
library(leaflet)

df <- data.frame(lat = runif(500, min = 39.25, max = 39.35),
                 lng = runif(500, min = -76.65, max = -76.55))
                 
df %>% 
    leaflet() %>% 
    addTiles() %>% 
    addMarkers(clusterOptions = markerClusterOptions())
```
